What is the difference between Shallow Copy and Deep copy?

Ans: Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.
Deep copy stores copies of the objects value.
Shallow repetition is quicker. However, it's "lazy" it handles pointers and references.
Rather than creating a contemporary copy of the particular knowledge the pointer points to,
it simply copies over the pointer price. So,


Shallow Copy	                                            Deep Copy
Shallow Copy stores the references
of objects to the original memory address.   	            Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.
Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the
new/copied object in the original object.	                Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.
Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object
and points the references to the objects.	                Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well.
Shallow copy is faster.	                                    Deep copy is comparatively slower.
