Write a method called reverse() with an int Array as a parameter.
The method shouldn't return any value.
In other words, the method is allowed to modify the array parameter.
In main(0 the test reverse method and print the array both reverse and non-reversed.

To reverse the array, You have to swap the elements, so that the first element
is swapped with the last element and so on.

For example, if the given array {4,5,6,7,8},
then the reversed array is {8,7,6,5,4}
