Aggregation


Aggregation

It is a special form of Association where:

    It represents Has-A relationship.

    It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship.
    For example, department can have students but vice versa is not possible
    and thus unidirectional in nature.

    In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually
    which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity


    Has-A relationship


    When do we use Aggregation ??
    Code reuse is best achieved by aggregation.

    Composition

    Composition

    Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities
    are highly dependent on each other.

        It represents part-of relationship.
        In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
        When there is a composition between two entities, the composed
        object cannot exist without the other entity.

    Letâ€™s take the example of the Library.

    Note: This is the program is not only for aggregation example
    also best practice
    for List<>() , arrayList
