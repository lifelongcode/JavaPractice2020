Abstract Classes and Methods
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

* Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects
    (to access it, it must be inherited from another class. In general, we can extend it.)

* Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
The body is provided by the subclass(inherited from).

An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods.



abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void animalSound();
  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}



From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:

Animal myObj = new Animal(); // will generate an error
