The question here is how to remove white spaces.

For example,
String name = "Abraham Parker";

if we print the length of the name String
it will show 14 including white space


Now, let's say we want to remove the white spaces and want to count the string.
So, we have to create another String because String is predefine, immutable

String nameWithoutSpaces = name.replaceAll("\\+","");

then if we do
System.out.println("Length of the nameWithoutSpaces is " + nameWithoutSpaces.length());
it will print out 13
