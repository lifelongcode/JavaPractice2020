Q. Pennies for Pay
Write a program that calculates the amount a person would earn over a period of time
if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day,
and continues to double each day. The program should display a table showing
the salary for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period.
The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies.
Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days worked.
