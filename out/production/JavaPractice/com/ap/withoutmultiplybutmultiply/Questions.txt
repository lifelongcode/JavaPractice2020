Q. Create a method which will take two arguments and result will be multiplication
For example, this is generally done.

public int multiply(int a, int b){
return a * b;
}

Above we used to do that. right.
Now, the million-dollar question in the table is,
write the method do not use the multiplication operator *.

Example (5, 3)
We are going to do recursive method
if(b > 0)
            return (a +  multiply(a, b-1)); //First Step
            return (a +  multiply(a, b-1)); //Second Step
            return (a +  multiply(a, b-1)); //Third Step



            But inside it would do

            First Step:
            (5 + multiply(5, 3-1));
            Second Step
            (5 + multiply(5, 2-1));
            Third Step:
            (5 + multiply(5, 1-1));
            Stop here.

            So, it returns like that
            [(5 + [ multiply(5, 3-1) ]) + (5 + [multiply(5, 2-1)])+(5 + [multiply(5, 1-1)])]
            After 3 times play it won't go anymore.
            The best thinking is that recursive stop when b comes 0
