We use the integers a,b , and n to create the following series:

You are given
queries in the form of a, b, and n . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given , , and values as a single line of

space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai,bi , and ni
//Not a i is here imaginary small case i.
values for that query.

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of

space-separated integers.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5

Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98

Explanation

We have two queries:

    We use

, , and to produce some series

:

... and so on.

Once we hit

, we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

We use
, , and to produce some series

:

    We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.
